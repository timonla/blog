# Down to Earth - Whole Foods Plant Based Diet

My diet is a very important topic for me and as such I am willing to experiment a lot with it and throw everything,
I thought I knew, overboard if I obtain some new information.
From time to time I like to review my diet on whatever factors I recently altered.

#### What is new, what am I trying to change right now?
The main subjects under review for this week are affordability and the amount of processed/packaged foods that I consume.
I recently started cutting down on packaged foods such as Oat drinks, pre cooked beans and tofu.
As I was quite happy with the diet in the past month I am simply interested in what amount of money I have to spend on,
what I consider, a healthy diet, without growing my own vegetables or having to compromise on non-organic food.

I am also interested in the Omega 3/6 ration as I have not checked this for a while.

#### About this post

The idea of making this review public is to share my day to day experience with my diet in great detail, as I receive questions on
inspiration on a regular basis and feel that most *What I eat in a day* content on social media only shows the glorious parts or
is simply not detailed enough.

(I will try to put slightly more effort into making the food look appealing in the photos.)

I will give some more details on the daily decisions that I make in the logbook but as a start here is a concise overview.

#### What labels do I assign my diet?

This list is by no means *static* or *final* but at the time of writing this:
* I am following a vegan diet for both ethic and health related reasons
* I try to eat as many *whole foods*/*unprocessed foods* as possible
* I avoid gluten if possible
* I don't consume alcohol (apart from my vitamin B12 drops)
* I avoid caffeine
* I avoid salt if possible
* My diet is high carb / low fat

If you are interested in some more inspiration on similar diets I can highly recomment:
* Dr. Greger's Book [HOW NOT TO DIE](https://nutritionfacts.org/book/how-not-to-die/) as well as
[NutritionalFacts.org](https://nutritionfacts.org/) in general
* Simnett Nutrition's [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpyhJZhJQWKDdJCR07jPY-Q)
* Mic the Vegan's [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGJq0eQZoFSwgcqgxIE9MHw)

### Review process

For every day, I will log:
* Time of waking up
* Time of going to bed
* Time of every food preparation performed
* Time of every meal
* Photo of every meal
* The first time I prepare a meal I will provide some more information on why I am eating this and how I am preparing it
* Grams for every ingredient (except spices) in [cronometer](https://cronometer.com/)
* Price per kg in Euro and SEK of every ingredient in Gothenburg/Sweden
* Calories burned

I am using [this scale](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B017NZNKYW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) which is not
super accurate when it comes to differences of single grams.
So I will weigh my spice glasses once at the start of the week and once at the end, to get a week average the price, I will NOT
log the grams of spices per meal in cronometer.

I will have to weigh a lot of foods twice as, for a banana for example, I want to track the calories of the part that ate,
but the price of the banana including its peel.

I will only track the calories and other nutritional facts once the experiment is over as to not influence my decision making
during the experiment.

## Disclaimer

As of writing this, I am working in the home office.
So there won't be as much meal prep as I might have done half a year ago.
However, considering the situation in the world right now, it's probably not as relevant as it used to be.

I usually exercise quite a lot and burn between 3000 and 4000 kcal a day.
The portion size will at times seem unreasonable.

I am not a great cook and don't have a lot of recipies to share.
I think of all the thinks I would like to eat and then assemble a dish of them.
For that I try to understand, through a lot of experiments, how certain ingredients will behave while cooking
and how to use that to my advantage.
This has worked fine for me in the past years.
I never find myself not finishing a meal, since when it's prepared with only nice ingredients, probably the end result is also nice :)

I am neither a medically or nutritionally trained.
What I document here is simply my experience and the decisions I make for me personally.
Please take this as an inspiration and perform drastic diet changes after consulting someone quallified or at your own risk.

## Logbook

### Supplements

##### Vitamin B12
I am using these [Vitamin B12 drops](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07K1D8M1N/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
One bottle contains 1700 drops of which I consume 5 per day (1000 mcg).
Hence, the bottle will last for 340 days, resulting in **0.07 EUR/0.70 SEK** per day.

The drops that I currently use still have an alcohol base, unlike the ones listed on amazon right now.

Make sure that you are buying B12 drops with **Methylcobalamin**.

##### Vitamin D3+K12
I am using these [Vitamin D3+K2 drops](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07BK9F7WB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
One bottle contains 1700 drops of which I consume 5 per day (125 mcg D3, 100 mcg K2).
Hence, the bottle will last for 340 days, resulting in **0.06 EUR/0.67 SEK** per day.

##### Iodine
I am using these [Iodine capsules](https://www.apotea.se/helhetshalsa-eko-jod-100-kapslar).
One container contains 100 capsules of which I consume 1 per day (150 mcg)
Hence, the bottle will last for 100 days, resulting in *0.15 EUR/1.55 SEK** per day.

I have tried putting dulse in my smoothies before but find that a tea spoon of that is capable of ruining the taste of a 1 liter smoothie.
I did it anyways but could not aquire the taste of it, even after having used it for over a year.
The capsules are much easier to use.

#### 7:30 Coconut oil

![Lemon water](assets/monday-lemon.jpg)

I got up at 7:30.
The first thing, when I get out of bed, is always to clean my tongue and pull some coconut
oil through my teeth.
I spit the oil out but thought since it's a food and I am tracking all kinds of stuff anyways,
might as well add it here :)

#### 7:50 Lemon water

The first thing I usually have in the morning is some lemon water.
Some times I just dring the lemon juice with water, sometimes I mix it with some herbal infusion.
This is also the time I take my supplements, so I don't forget them.

#### 9:40 Breakfast

![Breakfast](assets/monday-breakfast.jpg)

TODO: write about the different kinds of grains that you can use (cooked oats, overnight oats, spelt flakes, rice flakes, cornflakes, buckwheat cooked, buckwheat sprouted).

Spruting legumes and other seeds is a great way to get something fresh into your diet without
having to invest in, in my option, pointless iceberg lettuce or something similar.
It takes a bit of planning, as you will need to know a few days in advance, what you want to eat.
However, if you end up not eating them, they can be stored in the fridge for a few days and stop
growing.
On Sunday evening I soaked 30g of green lentils, 30g of sweet lupines, 20g of chickpeas
(all dry weights).
They will all take about 3 days, until they have my prefered size.

![Soaked legumes](assets/monay-soaked-beans.jpg)

If you are interested in sprouting your own beans, it's super easy to get started.
All you need are some big jars and some nets.
I cannot emphasize enough how much of a waste of money it is to buy sprouting kits!
Just buy mason jars and the lids.
Even if you later decide sprouting is not for you, they can be of great use in the kitchen.

TODO: add links to jars and lids

#### 13:28 Snack

![Snack while preparing lunch](assets/monday-snack.jpg)

I started preparing lunch and needed to eat something in between.
I like to snack on dried fruits and nuts.

#### 13:50 Lunch

![Monday lunch](assets/monday-lunch.jpg)

Even while working from home I usually cook one meal that I can have for lunch three days in a row to save some time in the kitchen.
This week this meal is a rice dish (eating lots of rice is a recurring theme in my diet :)) with some vegetables in a coconut milk sauce.
In the disclaimer I mentioned that I am a basic cook and this dish is the best proof for it.
Start by getting the rice to a boil and in the meantime throw all the other ingredients
(except for the starch) into another pot, and cook until the lentils are soft.
As spices I added: tumeric, coriander, ginger, chili, smoked paprika and cinamon.

Once the lentils are ready, I wait for it to cool down a slight bit, mix the starch with a hint of
water and then add it to the pot while stiring.
This will thicken the sauce a bit (or a lot, if you add too much).
It's important to not add it into a boiling liquid or it will harden immediately and you will
obtain a lumpy sauce.

I topped the portion that I ate directly off with some sesame seeds and nutritional yeast and
will likely do the same when I take the other portions out of the fridge.

The portions are not exactly equally large which is due to that I'd rather prepare a bit too much
sauce than too little, because dry food is the work of the devil.
Everything that does not fit into the lunch boxes has to be eaten on the same day.

#### 20:17 Soaking some beans

![Mais cakes](assets/monday-evening-snack.jpg)

Snacking on some mais cakes, while doing the dishes and soaking some legumes and sunflower seeds.
Rice and mais cakes fullfill two purposes in my kitchen.
Firstly, they are a great, quick and gluten free alternative to bread.

A few goto toppings are:

* Peanut butter, cinamon and bananas or dates
* Peanut butter, pickles and mustard
* Bean spread, onions and pickles
* Some condiment, tofu, onions, pickles

... I really like pickles but they can be replaced with Sauerkraut of kimchi as well.

Apart from that, rice and mais cakes are a nice, be it more bland, chips like snack which you
can even take with you if you are going for a long walk.
You can be sure that I will have a pack of them in my bagpack any time I go out and am uncertain
how long it is to the next meal or if the food will be good. (Just make sure that you have enough
water with you :desert:)

I simply wash the legumes and seeds in the glas before filling the entire container with water
and leaving it to soak for 12 hours.
Soaking times depend on what you want to sprout but 12 hours is long enough for most plants.
In the glas there are 41g of green lentils, 40g of sweet lupines, 21g of red lentils
and 20g of sunflower seeds (all dry weights).

![Soaking legumes & sunflower seeds](assets/monday-evening-beans.jpg)

#### 22:23 Going to bed

I try to avoid drinking water the last hour before going to bed and then will have one glas
immediately before lying down.
Like that I avoid having to get up to go to the bathroom at night and don't wake up completely
dehydrated.

![Lemon water](assets/tuesday-lemon.jpg)

Lemon water same as on Monday :)

I also rinsed the legumes I soaked on Monday and Sunday evening.

#### 10:27 Breakfast

![Beakfast](assets/tuesday-breakfast.jpg)

Same as yesterday, slightly less oats because slightly less hungry.
(And I put the coconut flakes on top because I find it looks more appealing in the photo :P)

#### 12:37 Lunch

![Lunch](assets/tuesday-lunch.jpg)

I got my lunch out of the fridge and sprinkled some nutritional yeast and sesame seeds on top.
Most times I don't bother to get it out of the lunch box and heat it up.
I just wait a bit and start eating.

#### 15:30 Isotonic drink

![Isotonic drink](assets/tuesday-iso.jpg)

#### 17:18 Dinner preparations

![Potatoe Soup](assets/tuesday-dinner-total.jpg)

Cut everything, put it into the pot and boil until the potatoes are good but not too soft.
The beet root will be still a bit crunchy.
Eating raw beet root is not for the light hearted.
I challenge you to try to eat a big beet root raw.
So make sure that you slice them in really small chunks.
Basil, ginger, tumeric, vegetable broth, smoked paprika
Add bikarbonat so that the tomatoes are not too sour.
Roast the pumpkin seeds.
Garnish with pumpkin seeds + nutritional yeast.

I got impatient and ate a few mais cakes :)

![Mais cakes](assets/tuesday-snack.jpg)

![Frozen beans](assets/tuesday-frozen-beans.jpg)

#### 18:10 Dinner 1/4

![Dinner one portion](assets/tuesday-dinner-single.jpg)

I don't have this big a dish so I'll split it up in 4 portions like this, that I will eat during the evening.

#### 18:50 Dinner 2/4

#### 19:53 Dinner 3/4

#### 20:27 Dinner 4/4

#### 23:52 Going to bed

Three portions would have been ideal.
The last one felt kind of forced.

In recent years I have cut down on the amount of bananas I eat.
These days I mainly eat them in my oat meal, on bike rides or in smoothies.
It's good practice to always have a large amount of bananas at your disposal.
You will be able to eat them when they are at their sweetest and if they at some point get too ripe, you can just freeze them
in smaller pieces.
Frozen bananas are excellent for smoothies or nice cream.
Also you can be sure to always have a *banana for size* at hand, if you take a photo of a big spider or something.

Well, making a smoothie is not exactly science.
Put all the stuff in the blender and blend :)
With so much frozen stuff, it's important to put the unfrozen stuff at the bottom and choose the exact right water temperature.

I usually follow my adaptation of [this recipe](https://www.theedgyveg.com/2015/04/20/jackfruit-carnitas-pulled-pork-tacos/)
mainly leaving out the oil and making it more spicy.
This time we decided to try out swapping out the jackfruit for mushrooms.
The mushrooms have a better taste but the texture of the jackfruit is better.
Also it was significantly more expensive to use mushrooms as they shrink so much during cooking.

### Results

### Conclusions

Having not tracked my food intake in a while I can definitely say that I did not miss it.
Especially documenting everthing in here and calculating the cost was no fun :).
This week however, seemed like a good representation for my diet in the recent weeks.
So I am at least happy with how that turned out.
Would be good to track time in the kitchen and actual time eating the next time.
Maybe use something like [jiffy](https://jiffy.nu/) to track it properly.
