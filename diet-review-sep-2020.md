# Down to Earth Vegan Diet Review

My diet is a very important topic for me and as such I am willing to experiment a lot with it and throw everything,
I thought I knew, overboard if I obtain some new information.
From time to time I like to review my diet on whatever factors I recently altered.

#### What is new, what am I trying to change right now?
The main subjects under review for this week are affordability and the amount of processed/packaged foods that I consume.
I recently started cutting down on packaged foods such as Oat drinks, pre cooked beans and tofu.
As I was quite happy with the diet in the past month I am simply interested in what amount of money I have to spend on,
what I consider, a healthy diet, without growing my own vegetables or having to compromise on non-organic food.

I am also interested in the Omega 3/6 ration as I have not checked this for a while.

#### About this post

The idea of making this review public is to share my day to day experience with my diet in great detail, as I receive questions on
inspiration on a regular basis and feel that most *What I eat in a day* content on social media only shows the glorious parts or
is simply not detailed enough.

(I will try to put slightly more effort into making the food look appealing in the photos.)

I will give some more details on the daily decisions that I make in the logbook but as a start here is a concise overview.

#### What labels do I assign my diet?

This list is by no means *static* or *final* but at the time of writing this:
* I am following a vegan diet for both ethic and health related reasons
* I try to eat as many *whole foods*/*unprocessed foods* as possible
* I avoid gluten if possible
* I don't consume alcohol (apart from my vitamin V12 drops)
* I avoid coffein
* I avoid salt if possible
* My diet is high carb / low fat

If you are interested in some more inspiration on similar diets I can highly recomment:
* Dr. Greger's Book [HOW NOT TO DIE](https://nutritionfacts.org/book/how-not-to-die/) as well as
[NutritionalFacts.org](https://nutritionfacts.org/) in general
* Simnett Nutrition's [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpyhJZhJQWKDdJCR07jPY-Q)
* Mic the Vegan's [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGJq0eQZoFSwgcqgxIE9MHw)

### Review process

For every day, I will log:
* Time of waking up
* Time of going to bed
* Time of every food preparation performed
* Time of every meal
* Photo of every meal
* The first time I prepare a meal I will provide some more information on why I am eating this and how I am preparing it
* Grams for every ingredient (except spices) in [cronometer](https://cronometer.com/)
* Price per kg in Euro and SEK of every ingredient in Gothenburg/Sweden
* Calories burned

I am using [this scale](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B017NZNKYW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) which is not
super accurate when it comes to differences of single grams.
So I will weigh my spice glasses once at the start of the week and once at the end, to get a week average the price, I will NOT
log the grams of spices per meal in cronometer.

I will have to weigh a lot of foods twice as, for a banana for example, I want to track the calories of the part that ate,
but the price of the banana including its peel.

## Disclaimer

As of writing this, I am working in the home office.
So there won't be as much meal prep as I might have done half a year ago.
However, considering the situation in the world right now, it's probably not as relevant as it used to be.

I usually exercise quite a lot and burn between 3000 and 4000 kcal a day.
The portion size will at times seem unreasonable.

I am not a great cook and don't have a lot of recipies to share.
I think of all the thinks I would like to eat and then assemble a dish of them.
For that I try to understand, through a lot of experiments, how certain ingredients will behave while cooking
and how to use that to my advantage.
This has worked fine for me in the past years.
I never find myself not finishing a meal, since when it's prepared with only nice ingredients, probably the end result is also nice :)

#### Supplements

##### Vitamin B12
I am using these [Vitamin B12 drops](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07K1D8M1N/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
One bottle contains 1700 drops of which I consume 5 per day (1000 mcg).
Hence, the bottle will last for 340 days, resulting in **0.07 EUR/0.70 SEK** per day.

Make sure that you are buying B12 drops with **Methylcobalamin**.

##### Vitamin D3+K12
I am using these [Vitamin D3+K2 drops](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07BK9F7WB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
One bottle contains 1700 drops of which I consume 5 per day (125 mcg D3, 100 mcg K2).
Hence, the bottle will last for 340 days, resulting in **0.06 EUR/0.67 SEK** per day.

##### Iodine
I am using these [Iodine capsules](https://www.apotea.se/helhetshalsa-eko-jod-100-kapslar).
One container contains 100 capsules of which I consume 1 per day (150 mcg)
Hence, the bottle will last for 100 days, resulting in *0.15 EUR/1.55 SEK** per day.

I have tried putting dulse in my smoothies before but find that a tea spoon of that is capable of ruining the taste of a 1 liter smoothie.
I did it anyways but could not aquire the taste of it, even after having used it for over a year.
The capsules are much easier to use.
